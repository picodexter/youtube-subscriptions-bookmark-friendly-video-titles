# YouTube Subscriptions Bookmark-Friendly Video Titles

This userscript automatically prepends the channel name and the video duration to the video titles in the subscription
feed.

Example:

*   Channel name: Example Channel
*   Video title: Example Video
*   Video duration: 1 hour, 2 minutes and 34 seconds
*   Changes the video title in the feed into: Example Channel [01:02:34] Example Video

The new video title enables you to immediately identify channel, duration and title at a single glance after adding
the video to your favorites / bookmark collection by dragging & dropping it via its video title, no editing or other
adjustments after the fact required.
